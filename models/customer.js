// 'address' is an array of 'AddressSchema' because a customer can have multiplr addresses saved.
// 'wishlist' (can also be termed as 'favorites') is collection of those products which are 'hearted' by the customer on the front end.
// 'cart_id' => will be added when the user adds something to his cart for the first time. This will be permanent after that.
